## Folders
This repository compiles the code used for all stages of our project. Within each folder, each of the relevant Jupyter Notebook files are immediately
available alongside the CSV files they read from. These files should not be removed from their respective folders.

## Running the Code
In order to run this code, you will need to install a working version of Python 3.12 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You will also need to have Jupyter Notebook installed from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

After downloading the files in whichever folder you wish to run, nativate to that volder in your terminal and use `jupyter notebook` to launch the application.
Then simply choose the file you wish to run.
